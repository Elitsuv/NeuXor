# ðŸ§  NeuXor â€” The XOR Neural Network
A minimal neural network built entirely from scratch using NumPy â€” designed to learn the classic XOR logic function.

> [!NOTE] 
> This project is experimental and intended for learning purposes only.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goal
To **demystify how neural networks work** under the hood by building one from scratch â€”  
no libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch â€” just pure matrix math using NumPy.

This project solves the **XOR problem**, which is not linearly separable (i.e., it can't be solved by a straight line).  
We use **1 hidden layer** with **2 neurons**, and **sigmoid** activations.

| Section            | What It Does                                      |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `X`, `Y`           | Input/Output values for XOR                       |
| `sigmoid()`        | Activation function                               |
| `derivative()`     | Used in backprop to adjust weights                |
| `w1`, `w2`, `b1`, `b2` | Random weights and biases for layers         |
| Forward Pass       | Calculates output                                 |
| Backward Pass      | Calculates how wrong and how to fix it            |
| Weight Update      | Adjusts weights and biases to improve accuracy    |
| Output             | Final predictions after training                  |
